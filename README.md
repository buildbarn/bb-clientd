# The Buildbarn client daemon [![Build status](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-clientd/workflows/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-clientd/actions) [![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/buildbarn/bb-clientd)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/buildbarn/bb-clientd) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/buildbarn/bb-clientd)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/buildbarn/bb-clientd)

Whereas most of the other Buildbarn repositories provide server-side
infrastructure, this repository provides a tool that's intended to be
run on your personal system: the Buildbarn client daemon, bb\_clientd
for short. The goal of bb\_clientd is twofold:

1. To provide insight in, and access to the data stored by
   [Remote Execution](https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis) services.
2. To speed up builds that use Remote Execution.

Even though this project is developed as part of the Buildbarn project,
and also reuses many of Buildbarn's components, bb\_clientd is expected
to be compatible with other implementations of the Remote Execution API.

This document will explain how to set up bb\_clientd and demonstrate its
features.

## Obtaining bb\_clientd

There are various ways in which a copy of bb\_clientd may be obtained:

- By running `bazel run //cmd/bb_clientd` inside this repository.
- By downloading [a precompiled binary or package built through GitHub Actions](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-clientd/actions?query=workflow%3Amaster).
- By downloading [a container image from the GitHub Packages page](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-remote-execution/pkgs/container/bb-clientd).
  Keep in mind that running bb\_clientd inside a Docker container may
  require it to be privileged, as bb\_clientd creates a FUSE mount.

## Running bb\_clientd...

### ... from within this source tree

After carefully reviewing the contents of
[configs/bb\_clientd.jsonnet](configs/bb_clientd.jsonnet) and making
changes where needed, you may run the following commands to launch
bb\_clientd:

```sh
umount ~/bb_clientd;Â fusermount -u ~/bb_clientd
export XDG_CACHE_HOME="${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-${HOME}/.cache}"
mkdir -p \
    "${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/bb_clientd/ac/persistent_state" \
    "${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/bb_clientd/cas/persistent_state" \
    "${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/bb_clientd/outputs" \
    ~/bb_clientd
OS="$(uname)" bazel run //cmd/bb_clientd "$(bazel info workspace)/configs/bb_clientd.jsonnet"
```

You may validate that bb\_clientd is running by inspecting the top-level
directory of its FUSE (Linux) or NFSv4 (macOS) mount:

```
$ ls -l ~/bb_clientd
total 0
d--x--x--x  1 root  wheel  0 Jan  1  2000 cas
dr-xr-xr-x  2 root  wheel  0 Jan  1  2000 outputs
drwxrwxrwx  1 root  wheel  0 Jan  1  2000 scratch
```

### ... as a systemd service

After installing the bb\_clientd Debian package ([available through GitHub Actions](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-clientd/actions?query=workflow%3Amaster))
you may launch it for any user on the system by running the following
commands:

```sh
systemctl enable --user bb_clientd
systemctl start --user bb_clientd
loginctl enable-linger
```

The following commands may be used to inspect its status and logs:

```sh
systemctl status --user bb_clientd
journalctl --user -u bb_clientd -f
```

By default, bb\_clientd will use the configuration file that is also
shipped with this repository. It is possible to override configuration
options by creating a file named `~/.config/bb_clientd/bb_clientd.jsonnet`
that uses the following structure:

```jsonnet
local defaultConfiguration = import 'bb_clientd_defaults.jsonnet';
defaultConfiguration {
  // Options that you want to override go here.
}
```

## Using bb\_clientd...

### ... as a proxy for gRPC requests

Bazel's way of communicating with the Remote Execution service may
sometimes be inefficient:

- Even though Bazel uses hashes as part of its state, it is not content
  addressed. This means that it may frequently download files
  redundantly. For example, in case a rebuild of an action yields files
  with the same contents, Bazel will still delete the old files and
  download them once again.

- Bazel does not cache the results of FindMissingBlobs() calls, meaning
  that it often looks up digests that it already requested recently.

bb\_clientd solves this by adding local caching. This cache is used for
all traffic passing through a single instance of bb\_clientd, meaning
that you will even see speedups when building multiple checkouts of the
same project, after running `bazel clean`, switching between clusters,
etc.

If you normally run Bazel to build with remote execution as follows:

```
bazel build --remote_executor mycluster-prod.example.com --remote_instance_name hello [more options]
```

You can let it use bb\_clientd by running it like this instead:

```
bazel build --remote_executor "unix://${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-${HOME}/.cache}/bb_clientd/grpc" --remote_instance_name mycluster-prod.example.com/hello [more options]
```

Notice how the hostname of the cluster has become a prefix of
`--remote_instance_name`. This is because bb\_clientd's example
configuration provides support for routing requests to multiple
clusters. It uses the instance name to determine to which cluster
traffic needs to be routed.

You may wish to add `--remote_bytestream_uri_prefix` to the `bazel build`
command with the URI of the _real_ remote executor. This will cause Bazel's
build event stream to emit URIs with this prefix rather than
`${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-${HOME}/.cache}/bb_clientd/grpc`. Some build event
consumers offer features that require access to the remote cache; this
is necssary for those features to access the canonical remote.

### ... as a system local cache

bb\_clientd's example configuration also reserves instance names
`local/*` to act as a general purpose remote cache, where each instance
name acts as its own namespace. This means that if you want to cache the
results of a build performed locally, you may run Bazel as follows:

```
bazel build --remote_cache "unix://${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-${HOME}/.cache}/bb_clientd/grpc" --remote_instance_name local/some/project --remote_upload_local_results=true [more options]
```

The advantage of this option over Bazel's own `--disk_cache` flag is
that the cache space is bounded in size and shared with that of
bb\_clientd's proxy feature.

### ... as a tool for exploring the Content Addressable Storage

When using the default configuration file, bb\_clientd will memorize the
credentials that were attached to any RPCs that were forwarded to the
Remote Execution service. This means that bb\_clientd can give you
direct access to your cluster's Content Addressable Storage, at least
until your token expires or bb\_clientd restarts.

The FUSE/NFSv4 file system provided by bb\_clientd automatically
generates a "blobs" directory for every instance name and digest function provided:

```
$ ls ~/bb_clientd/cas/mycluster-prod.example.com/hello/blobs/
md5/  sha1/  sha256/  sha256tree/  sha384/  sha512/
$ ls -l ~/bb_clientd/cas/mycluster-prod.example.com/hello/blobs/sha256
total 0
d--x--x--x  1 root  wheel  0 Jan  1  2000 directory
d--x--x--x  1 root  wheel  0 Jan  1  2000 executable
d--x--x--x  1 root  wheel  0 Jan  1  2000 file
d--x--x--x  1 root  wheel  0 Jan  1  2000 tree
```

You can use it to obtain the contents of individual files:

```
$ file -b ~/bb_clientd/cas/mycluster-prod.example.com/hello/blobs/file/22184d8f153d9e28ae827297dbe0c3459554abb384d7b5c9dc292e6c8f596882-799796
C++ source, UTF-8 Unicode (with BOM) text, with very long lines
```

Or view the contents of entire directories:

```
$ cd ~/bb_clientd/cas/mycluster-prod.example.com/hello/blobs/directory/aa58f5f12edcd4695af98aed13cf87c79bd537e5bfc2c0d21fb0b6e695c94ce9-175
$ find . -ls
 7826520175049250699  0 dr-xr-xr-x    1 root  root     0 Jan  1  2000 .
17991803894754190639  0 dr-xr-xr-x    1 root  root     0 Jan  1  2000 ./runfiles
18404615058361292775  0 -r-xr-xr-x 9999 root  root  8340 Jan  1  2000 ./runfiles/runfiles.h
 7642484527095133707  0 -r-xr-xr-x 9999 root  root   744 Jan  1  2000 ./grep-includes.sh
```

All of the content accessed through the "cas" directory is lazy-loading,
and is cached locally.

### ... as a playground

The FUSE/NFSv4 file system also provides a "scratch" directory that you
can (mostly) use like an ordinary directory on your system. Because it
resides on the same file system as the "cas" directory shown above, it
is possible to create hard links to files that are backed by the Content
Addressable Storage. This may be useful when trying to reproduce
problems locally, without needing to download all of the files up front.

```
$ cp -lr ~/bb_clientd/cas/mycluster-prod.example.com/hello/blobs/directory/9b6841c638336162fdad886ac3294425a6e73bb38a227562e7feb6a950c5e5fb-165 ~/bb_clientd/scratch/my-broken-test
$ cd ~/bb_clientd/scratch/my-broken-test
$ ls -l
total 0
drwxrwxrwx  1 root  wheel  0 Jan  1  2000 bazel-out
drwxrwxrwx  1 root  wheel  0 Jan  1  2000 external
$ ~/bb_clientd/cas/mycluster-prod.example.com/hello/blobs/command/85c0c6b2464de5e738b650ea8f674961885b12e287ff360695459ef107801166-6426
exec ${PAGER:-/usr/bin/less} "$0" || exit 1
Executing tests from //:hello_world
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Segmentation fault
```

Note that if your implementation of `cp` does not support the `-l` flag,
you may need to install GNU Coreutils or use `rsync` with the
`--link-dest` flag.

Actions executing this way may directly write data into the file system.
The backing store for this is configured through the "filePool" option
in the bb\_clientd configuration file. Keep in mind that none of the
data written into the "scratch" directory is persisted across restarts
of bb\_clientd!

### ... to perform Remote Builds without the Bytes

Bazel 0.25 and later provide a feature named ["Remote Builds without the Bytes"](https://blog.bazel.build/2019/05/07/builds-without-bytes.html).
By enabling flags such as `--remote_download_minimal`, Bazel will no
longer download output files of build actions and store them in
`bazel-out/`. Though this speeds up builds significantly, there are two
disadvantages:

- You can no longer access output files. This may be acceptable if you
  only want to know whether a build succeeds (e.g., CI presubmit
  checks), but it cannot be used universally.
- It doesn't provide fast incremental builds. For each of the files that
  is normally downloaded, Bazel creates an in-memory reference to the
  remote instance of the file. This information is discarded at the end
  of the build, meaning that Bazel can't continue where it left off.

To solve these issues, bb\_clientd implements a gRPC API named the
Bazel Output Service. Bazel can use this API to store the entire
`bazel-out/` directory inside the FUSE/NFSv4 file system. Every time
Bazel needs to download a file from the Remote Execution service, it
calls into a `BatchCreate()` gRPC method. bb\_clientd implements this
method by creating lazy-loading files, just like the ones in the "cas"
directory. This means that you can enjoy the performance improvements of
"Remote Builds without the Bytes", but not with the restrictions that it
currently imposes.

Bazel 7.2 and later implement support for the Bazel Output Service.
Bazel can be configured to use this feature by providing the following
additional command line arguments:

```
--experimental_remote_output_service "unix://${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-${HOME}/.cache}/bb_clientd/grpc" --experimental_remote_output_service_output_path_prefix "${HOME}/bb_clientd/outputs"
```
